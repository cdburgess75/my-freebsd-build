+	<p>Colton Myers reports:</p>
+	<blockquote cite="http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/releases/2015.5.0.html">
+	  <p>In order to fix potential shell injection vulnerabilities in salt
+	     modules, a change has been made to the various cmd module functions.
+	     These functions now default to python_shell=False, which means that
+	     the commands will not be sent to an actual shell.</p>
+	  <p>The largest side effect of this change is that "shellisms", such as
+	     pipes, will not work by default. The modules shipped with salt have
+	     been audited to fix any issues that might have arisen from this
+	     change. Additionally, the cmd state module has been unaffected, and
+	     use of cmd.run in jinja is also unaffected. cmd.run calls on the
+	     CLI will also allow shellisms.</p>
+	  <p>However, custom execution modules which use shellisms in cmd calls
+	     will break, unless you pass python_shell=True to these calls.</p>
+	  <p>As a temporary workaround, you can set cmd_safe: False in your
+	     minion and master configs. This will revert the default, but is
+	     also less secure, as it will allow shell injection vulnerabilities
+	     to be written in custom code. We recommend you only set this
+	     setting for as long as it takes to resolve these issues in your
+	     custom code, then remove the override.</p>
